-make it rock less (wheel speed/weight distribution)
-tension on intake chain
    -maybe move back sprocket back a hole
-try to figure out angled standoff between intake and tower
    -or replace standoffs with something better
    -could use full length piece for intakes and make them go all the way back
-practice
-sensors

Tower:
  -make tower sockets with chain closer to metal piece
  -put on another vertical pice on left side of tower
  -move plates onto sides of towers

Chassis:
  -add another standoff between sides of the Chassis
      -maybe also replace front standoff with stronger metal piece
          -do 2 standoffs and 2 flat metal pieces
          -washers between the standoff and metal, spacers between screw head and metal
  -replace extending metal on chassis with something else
  -take off bearings from failed gearing attempt
  -make axels on chassis all the same length so it can be flat on the wall
  -if at all possible increase speed of Chassis
  -tighten back connection screws

Hood:
  -put extra standoff on hood and use a longer screw
  -ensure hood is within height
  -maybe make it shorter
  -redo mesh
  -make shorter to decrease weight
